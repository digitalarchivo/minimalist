                    "description": "Morpho Blue is a decentralized protocol enabling the overcollateralized lending and borrowing of crypto assets (ERC20 Tokens) on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The protocol is implemented as an immutable smart contract, engineered to serve as a trustless base layer for lenders, borrowers, and applications.\n\nMorpho Blue is licensed under a dual license (BUSL-1.1 and GPLv2) which you can find [here](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue/blob/main/LICENSE). Once deployed, Morpho Blue will function in perpetuity, provided the existence of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### Why\n\nWithin a year, Morpho has become the third-largest lending platform on Ethereum, with over $1.5B in deposited assets.\n\nMorpho's initial version, Morpho Optimizer, operates on top of Compound and Aave to enhance the efficiency of their interest rate model. But consequently, Morpho Optimizer’s growth is constrained by the current underlying lending pool design.\n\nIn particular, the current lending paradigm is:\n\n- Not Trustless: It relies heavily on its DAO and trusted contractors to monitor and update hundreds of risk parameters daily or upgrade large smart contracts.\n\n- Not Efficient: It provides inefficient rate spread, low collateralization factors, and charges fees to maintain the platform itself.\n\n- Not Flexible: It has a limited number of assets listed. Users have no choice but to subscribe to the one-size-fits-all risk-return profile proposed by the DAO.\n\nAlthough DeFi lending has grown rapidly under existing protocols like Aave and Compound, we need to rethink decentralized lending from the ground up to reach the next order of magnitude. Having spent two years developing the most significant platform built on top of these onchain funds, Morpho is uniquely positioned to recognize and address its limitations. As anticipated in the initial whitepaper, Morpho must metamorphose to become fully autonomous and improve the current state of DeFi lending.\n\nWe call this evolution Morpho Blue 🟦.\n",

Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code. Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.\n",

These include negative P\\\u0026L month by month, lack of income stream diversity, sub-optimal financial reporting and planning, ineffective grants program, continuous sell pressure on MANA, and lack of robust treasury management. While these challenges are common across many DAO and can be resolved with the right corrective actions, the financial future of the DAO may be at risk without immediate intervention.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nHire service providers with the right skillset, comprising experts from Avantgarde (https://avantgarde.finance) and r3gen finance (https://r3gen.finance) to address the identified financial challenges. These contributors will focus on financial reporting, budgeting \u0026 planning and treasury management. r3gen will provide Big-4 accounting expertise, while Avantgarde will leverage its treasury management capabilities. The implementation of the treasury management will be conducted on Enzyme (https://enzyme.finance), a DeFi protocol that is best-in-class for control, transparency and trustless delegation.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe primary audience for this proposal is the Decentraland DAO community, key stakeholders, and delegates. r3gen and Avantgarde aim to gather feedback and build consensus among stakeholders to ensure alignment with the DAO's long-term objectives.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nThe current challenges facing the Decentraland DAO necessitate swift action. With monthly expenses surpassing income, lack of income stream diversity, and inefficiencies in financial reporting and planning, the DAO's financial future is in jeopardy. Establishing a service agreement now will enhance financial transparency, optimise treasury funds, and support the sustainability and growth of the Decentraland metaverse. By addressing these challenges now, the DAO can secure its financial future and enhance its long term impact, prosperity, and success.\n\nFor the full fledged proposal, please read more here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pzg6LgqswNBZTbIkvgXUWBQC2c_DZfS-GtS50sa0Mqo/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n\u003e * **The pool shall has a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n\u003e # References/Useful links\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IAVN7mDiPt4teeuBUMqi0KJdZ2aiRWwGAxRhJU75TB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\u003e * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n\u003e * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n\u003e * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n\u003e * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\u003e * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n\u003e # Protocol description\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e * Staked FRAX (sFRAX) is an ERC4626 staking vault that distributes part of the Frax Protocol yield weekly to stakers denominated in FRAX stablecoins. The sFRAX token represents pro rata deposits within the vault and is always withdrawable for FRAX stablecoins at the pro rata rate at all times. - [Frax ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n\u003e * Frax Finance is a decentralized lending platform which issues the FRAX stablecoin. Frax Finance algorithmically sustains the value of FRAX through the use of fractional collateral reserves. The collateral used on Frax Finance is split between an accepted collateral (e.g. ether) and Frax Finance’s governance token, FXS. The collateralization ratio for FRAX changes based on its price. - [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/pt-BR/prices/Frax?timestamp=1705682853673)\n\n\u003e # Motivation\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n\u003e * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. A similar E-CLP to the one mentioned in this proposal has been recently deployed on Arbitrum. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: [https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps)\n\n\u003e # Specifications\n\u003e \u003e ## Governance\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum.

                "body": "This proposal suggests changing the limits for the current setup on Mainnet.\n\n## Usage of quotas\n\nAbout 2.5 months have already passed since the launch of v3 on the Mainnet, so I would like to analyze which assets are in demand and which are not. As you remember, gearbox v3 has quota functionality for each asset, which allows to manage how much money from the pool will be allocated to the asset. This allows to properly manage risk in the protocol.\n\nCurrent allocation of funds in Credit Accounts are shown in image below (you can check yourself in [Dune](https://dune.com/queries/3499396/5884967)). The main use case now is LSD and LRT (which is obvious due to the hype of recent weeks): ~50M in weETH, ~40M in ezETH, ~3.5M in stETH. We also see that WBTC, USDC, WETH are used (for PURE).\n\n![pic_1802.png](ipfs://bafkreidrrup56bl72eyfvltxybmpz7fcxnpuisizuu3vd3zu2hjopw2j2y)\n \nHowever, it is interesting to analyze other assets - whether they are in demand at all. It can be seen that LINK, UNI, LDO, CVX are also used as trading assets, but their volume is limited to 0.5M in total (you can check current Quota limits [here](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x529dee318dcdb95b9b9d5172c4cc78fef849434b8bfe42cae534fa9ea842fd82))\n\n![pic_1803.png](ipfs://bafkreidp44n7pelhd64suxkcajv7apkvlbzbzrtujehzzkchgdpwyhg7ca)\n    \n\nTherefore it is proposed to reduce the max quota Limit for Tier 2,3 assets  following this table:\n\n|     | **for USDC POOL** | **for WBTC pool** | **For WETH pool** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| UNI | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| LINK | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| LDO | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| CRV | 200,000 USDC | 3 WBTC | 55 WETH |\n| CVX | 200,000 USDC | 3 WBTC | 55 WETH |\n\nAlso, due to the lack of demand, it is proposed to set a Quota Limits for APE and FXS to 0 for USDC,WBTC,WETH pools.\n\n## Boosting LRTs \n    \n\nNow weETH and ezETH limits are used on 75%+ in WETH Credit Manager. Therefore a further increase in the limit on weETH and ezETH is proposed. But due to the large allocation of funds to LRT, it is proposed to take into account the depth of liquidity for each of the LRTs. Of course, a withdrawal despite a delay of 7 days will be a good arbitrage opportunity, however, due to the delay there may be short-term price fluctuations, so deeper liquidity is a plus. Below you can see selling pressure that leads to 1% price impact on Mainnet:\n\n| Price impact | weETH | ezETH |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1%  | 6,965 eth | 11,660 eth |\n\n\\* 1inch is used to define price impact\n\n1. It is proposed to set quota limits not exceeding x3 of the available liquidity on DEXs. Accordingly, the maximum quota limit for weETH will be 21,000 eth, for ezETH 35,000 eth. \n2. It is proposed to increase the Quota Limit for each asset gradually, increment step is 5,000 eth. Quota Limit within values at p.1 can be increased by Technical Multisig as soon as Quota Usage reaches 80%+.\n\n## Voting\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

It also involves removing the StkGHO component from the \"Staker\" boost and approving the delayed start of GHO distribution.\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo expand the Merit reward system scope and address concerns about long-term AAVE rewards for StkGHO holders, we propose introducing a new rewarded action: \"Hold StkGHO.\" This change allows for a smooth transition to a safety module that is eventually 100% rewarded in GHO.\n\nWhile there is an overlap between \"Borrow GHO\" and \"Hold StkGHO\" rewarded users, this outcome is considered acceptable. The introduction of a new rewarded action for \"Hold StkGHO\" allows us to address concerns about rewarding users for non-enforcable actions due to the GHO borrow cap reached. \"Holding StkGHO is an incentive to liquidity sink GHO and secondary market demand.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n1. Introduce a new rewarded action, \"Hold StkGHO.\"\n2. Remove the StkGHO component from the \"Staker\" boost to avoid circular logic.\n3. Approve the delayed start of GHO distribution within the Merit program.\n4. Prioritize StkGHO holders' rewarded actions over having GHO debt in the Merit distribution as long as the GHO borrow cap remains below 50M.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If this proposal reaches consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The protocol is implemented as an immutable smart contract, engineered to serve as a trustless base layer for lenders, borrowers, and applications.\n\nMorpho Blue is licensed under a dual license (BUSL-1.1 and GPLv2) which you can find [here](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue/blob/main/LICENSE). Once deployed, Morpho Blue will function in perpetuity, provided the existence of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### Why\n\nWithin a year, Morpho has become the third-largest lending platform on Ethereum, with over $1.5B in deposited assets.\n\nMorpho's initial version, Morpho Optimizer, operates on top of Compound and Aave to enhance the efficiency of their interest rate model. But consequently, Morpho Optimizer’s growth is constrained by the current underlying lending pool design.\n\nIn particular, the current lending paradigm is:\n\n- Not Trustless: It relies heavily on its DAO and trusted contractors to monitor and update hundreds of risk parameters daily or upgrade large smart contracts.\n\n- Not Efficient: It provides inefficient rate spread, low collateralization factors, and charges fees to maintain the platform itself.\n\n- Not Flexible: It has a limited number of assets listed. Users have no choice but to subscribe to the one-size-fits-all risk-return profile proposed by the DAO.\n\nAlthough DeFi lending has grown rapidly under existing protocols like Aave and Compound, we need to rethink decentralized lending from the ground up to reach the next order of magnitude. Having spent two years developing the most significant platform built on top of these onchain funds, Morpho is uniquely positioned to recognize and address its limitations. As anticipated in the initial whitepaper, Morpho must metamorphose to become fully autonomous and improve the current state of DeFi lending.\n\nWe call this evolution Morpho Blue 🟦.\n",

It is clearly stipulated by Arbitrum that this airdrop is for the DAO and that it should be sent to the treasury multisig. The ARB tokens were part of the 113 million tokens allocated to: [\"DAOs building apps on Arbitrum (via airdrop to DAO treasury addresses)\"](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution#distribution-post-aips-11-and-12)\n\nSushi operations team has a multisig wallet which is used by the operations team, this is not the DAO multisig wallet and is not governed by the DAO treasury signatories. The operations team multisig wallet is governed exclusively by operations team signers and is not governed by DAO votes presently.\n\nThe Sushi operations team incorrectly supplied the address of their operations team wallet on Arbitrum and to date the tokens have yet to be sent to their rightful home which is the DAO treasury wallet. https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1638263069271891971\n\nThis situation is further compounded by the fact that the operations team continues to withhold treasury funds, that are inappropriately in their possession, as a result of their continued refusal to respect the snapshot votes that govern the funds and specifies their rightful home being the DAO treasury.\n\nLikewise it is highly possible that the operations team have set up legal entities on behalf of Sushi DAO without disclosing the make up of them. The DAO is simply left in the dark on this most fundamental part of Sushi DAO.\n\nImmediate action is required to protect the DAO from any potential misallocations of these funds.\n\nThis snapshot formally calls for the sushi operations team to send the Arbitrum airdrop to the DAO treasury immediately.\n\n## Vote\n\nYay: Send the ARB tokens airdropped by Arbitrum to a contract address under the custody of Sushi's treasury multisig.\n\nNay: Do nothing",

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n\u003e * **The pool shall has a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n\u003e # References/Useful links\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IAVN7mDiPt4teeuBUMqi0KJdZ2aiRWwGAxRhJU75TB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\u003e * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n\u003e * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n\u003e * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n\u003e * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\u003e * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n\u003e # Protocol description\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e * Staked FRAX (sFRAX) is an ERC4626 staking vault that distributes part of the Frax Protocol yield weekly to stakers denominated in FRAX stablecoins. The sFRAX token represents pro rata deposits within the vault and is always withdrawable for FRAX stablecoins at the pro rata rate at all times. - [Frax ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n\u003e * Frax Finance is a decentralized lending platform which issues the FRAX stablecoin. Frax Finance algorithmically sustains the value of FRAX through the use of fractional collateral reserves. The collateral used on Frax Finance is split between an accepted collateral (e.g. ether) and Frax Finance’s governance token, FXS. The collateralization ratio for FRAX changes based on its price. - [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/pt-BR/prices/Frax?timestamp=1705682853673)\n\n\u003e # Motivation\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n\u003e * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. A similar E-CLP to the one mentioned in this proposal has been recently deployed on Arbitrum.

This allows fETH to hold its value well in any market condition.\n\nWhen f(x) Protocol first launched in August of 2023, f(x) introduced the DeFi world to something special: a powerful new defi primitive centered around a complimentary token pair. The f(x) pair, or “stable-leverage pair” primitive is based on a simple concept: split a yield-bearing token (called the base or reserve token) into two parts: a low-volatility (i.e. stable) part and a high volatility (i.e. “leveraged”) part, both tokenized. Stable tokens can be staked in a rebalancing pool to earn yield from the reserve tokens, while the high volatility tokens protect the peg simply by existing, themselves providing a remarkably simple, safe, and cheap way to take ETH leverage.\n\nAs the protocol has gained attention and adoption, our community highlighted the need of a fully decentralized and hard pegged stablecoin. After extensive discussions and governance process, Aladdin DAO is now prepared to introduce f(x) Protocol’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, fxUSD.\n\nAs a stablecoin, fxUSD offers four key features never before combined:\n\n* Built-in yield, derived from LSDs in the reserve\n* Scalability: rapidly scalable based on direct demand\n* Stability: reliable peg in both directions, backed by f(x)’s invariant\n* Resilience: collateralized by Ethereum LSDs, with zero real-world asset exposure\n\nAt genesis, we are choosing 5 stablecoins to pair fxUSD with: FRAX (Frax Finance), crvUSD (Curve Finance), pyUSD (Paypal), DOLA (Inverse Protocol) and GRAI (Gravita Protocol). We are aiming for all these pools to have double gauges, on Curve and f(x). Each partner will either use owned vlCVX or veCRV to vote for incentives on Curve’s gauge or will incentives veFXN votes on f(x) Protocol’s gauge.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nIncreasing liquidity and visibility for the fxUSD/FRAX pool is critical to the operation of f(x) Protocol. It would also be beneficial and additive to the ecosystem in the following ways:\n\n* Having higher rewards will incentives more users to deposit in the pool, getting more FRAX deposited;\n* Having a deeper pool will help stabilize FRAX’s peg;\n* fxUSD is backed in part by frxETH; attracting more deposits will increase the minting of fxUSD, thus increasing frxETH supply.\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nIn order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support fxUSD - FRAX swaps we propose that Frax vote with 100,000 vlCVX/ epoch for the fxUSD/FRAX pool for the next 12 epochs on Votium. In exchange, f(x) will use treasury owned veFXN to vote on f(x) Protocol gauge in order to match Curve’s rewards for the same duration.\n\n- **For**: Use 100,000.00 vlCVX to vote for fxUSD/FRAX LP gauge on Curve Finance for 6 months.\n\n- **Against**: Do nothing.",

Thanks to the detection and response, this vulnerability was never exploited (other than DeFi Saver's white hack of course). This event is not a hack, but a security incident.",

The loss was minor (20% of the protocol) where a major hack is defined as 25%.  While they have tried to contact the hacker (without a reply).  This gives them a 25% penalty.\n\nExactly was one of our highest scoring protocols and a holder of our quality certificate.  What do we do about a certificate after an incident like this?",

This was a minor hack by TVL. Since no user funds were at risk, we will penalise as if ApolloX repaid their users.

This hack was made possible through the presence of a vulnerability within an old MetSwapUtils library, which was [documented by the team](https://blog.saddle.finance/metapool-exploit-fix-is-live/), and from which the protocol has since migrated away from. However, the protocol's swap calculations still pointed to the vulnerable old library instead of the new one. As such, the exploiter was able to manipulate the calculation of the value of the LP token during metapool swaps through a flash loan attack and repeatedly swap out/harvest stablecoins before the pool could do proper calculations.",

The first time, via a sophisticated and capital-intensive market manipulation, a hacker was able to withdraw over $15.6M in user funds. By successfully manipulating the price of $INV, the hacker heavily inflated the value of INV which was used as collateral. This allowed them to borrow millions from Anchor’s pools. According to DeFi Safety and rekt.news, the hacker’s rather professional tactic revealed an unforeseen attack vector. In other words, this was not an obvious vulnerability. Altogether, the hacker was able to run away with 1,588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 39 YFI, and 3,999,669 DOLA (worth $15.6M at the time).\nThe second exploit happened two months later. This time a flash loan attack led to $5.8M lost overall. The hacker was able to run away with $1.2M. This second attack was deemed “foreseeable” by DFS.",

The DebtRepayer allows holders of the IOU tokens to withdraw the original collateral. Inverse regularly fills the contract with WBTC, YFI, and ETH by forwarding some of their income to DebtRepayer. Users can then withdraw the collected funds. The DebtConverter is the second contract that lets users convert their IOU tokens (anETH, anWBTC, or anYFI) into IOU tokens that are denominated in DOLA. The DAO regularly funds it with DOLA, which can be withdrawn by holders of anTokens.",

The first time, via a sophisticated and capital-intensive market manipulation, a hacker was able to withdraw over $15.6M in user funds. By successfully manipulating the price of $INV, the hacker heavily inflated the value of INV which was used as collateral. This allowed them to borrow millions from Anchor’s pools. According to DeFi Safety and rekt.news, the hacker’s rather professional tactic revealed an unforeseen attack vector. In other words, this was not an obvious vulnerability. Altogether, the hacker was able to run away with 1,588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 39 YFI, and 3,999,669 DOLA (worth $15.6M at the time).\nThe second exploit happened two months later. This time a flash loan attack led to $5.8M lost overall. The hacker was able to run away with $1.2M. This second attack was deemed “foreseeable” by DFS.",

The DebtRepayer allows holders of the IOU tokens to withdraw the original collateral. Inverse regularly fills the contract with WBTC, YFI, and ETH by forwarding some of their income to DebtRepayer. Users can then withdraw the collected funds. The DebtConverter is the second contract that lets users convert their IOU tokens (anETH, anWBTC, or anYFI) into IOU tokens that are denominated in DOLA. The DAO regularly funds it with DOLA, which can be withdrawn by holders of anTokens.",

Several pools were paused temporarily, and users were urged to withdraw their Liquidity Provider (LP) assets promptly.\n\nOn August 27, the MistEye system by SlowMist detected suspicious transactions exploiting the Balancer vulnerability.  Total loss was 580k (1.7% of TVL) .  This was an unforeseeable event which was not paid back.  This results in a 15% penalty until 25 Feb 2024.",

                        "description": "Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol (DEX). It allows people to set up or contribute to liquidity pools consisting of various ERC-20 token pairs, or to use the available liquidity to swap their tokens against another using its Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanism. \n\n\n### Why\n\nAMMS are one of the building blocks in the crypto space as they always provide users with a price between two assets. Uniswap uses a simple  X * Y = K, formula to price assets where x is the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, and y is the amount of the other. k is a fixed constant, meaning the pool’s total liquidity is always the same. \n\n\n### Risk\n\nThere are various risks involved with using AMMS. These include but are not limited to:\nProtocol Risk - risk due to mechanics in the design of a protocol. Even when the protocol functions as intended there might be risks e.g. high slippage incurred in trades due to the liquidity curve set-up\nSmart contract risk - This is risk from an error in the code causing the contract to operate in ways unexpected by the developers. It might leave the code vulnerable to exploits or other attacks\nCybersecurity risk - Hackers, Exploiters or other malicious actors trying to attack Uniswap \n\n\n### Reward\n\nUniswap is arguably one of the largest AMMs in crypto and is usually the protocol where tokens find the most liquidity. Its UI/UX is extremely simple and users can trade most tokens with little problems.   \n",

                        "description": "### What\n\nLido is an open source tool and family of protocols that enables users to mint liquid staking tokens (sTokens) - These liquid staking tokens receive rewards from validation activities of writing data to the blockchain, but unlike their staked counterparts, are \"unlocked\" which means they can be used in other on-chain activities, like DeFi. \n\nLido protocols let users stake native tokens (ETH, MATIC, SOL) from Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana networks in a fully permissionless way. And as the protocols are deployed on public blockchains, users do not need the website to access the smart contracts.\n\n### Why\n\nTraditional staking means that users need to lock-up their ETH or other native asset to be able to secure the network and receive the respective rewards. However, this means that these tokens can't be used for anything else while they are staked. Lido aims to solve this problem. \n\nLido protocols give users liquidity - users are able to receive staking rewards from validation activities, but can sell their stTokens (tokens minted on Lido) anytime they want to exit their staking position. \n\nIn addition, it allows users to participate in DeFi while getting rewards - Because sTokens are unstaked and thus \"liquid\", users can use stTokens as building blocks in DeFi protocols at the same time as getting staking rewards from validating activities.\n\nThe Lido DAO also works with experienced node operators, which decreases the likelihood of technical mistakes that could lead to slashing or penalties and minimizes the technical burden for users to receive staking rewards. Users supply the stake, and the node operators supply the know-how.\n",

                        "description": "### What\n\nEuler is a non-custodial permissionless protocol on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow almost any crypto asset. Euler helps users to earn interest on their crypto assets or hedge against volatile markets without the need for a trusted third-party.\n\n### Why?\n\nEuler introduces a number of new features in DeFi, including permissionless lending markets, protected collateral, reactive interest rates, per-second compounding interests and feeless flash loans.\n\n#### Permisionless listing \n\nEuler lets its users determine which assets are listed. Any asset that has a WETH pair on Uniswap v3 can be added as a lending market on Euler.\n\n#### Protected Collateral\n\nOn Compound and Aave, collateral deposited to the protocol is always made available for lending. On the other hand, Euler allows collateral to be deposited, but not made available for lending.  This collateral is 'protected'. It doesn't earn interest, but is free from the risks of borrowers defaulting, can always be withdrawn instantly, and helps protect against borrowers using tokens to influence governance decisions.\n\n#### Reactive interest rates\n\nEuler uses control theory to autonomously change the interest rates towards a level that maximises utilisation of assets in the protocol. These reactive interest rates adapt to market conditions for the asset in real-time without the need for ongoing governance intervention. \n\n#### Compound Interest\n\nCompound interest is accrued on Euler each second. This is different from other lending protocols, where interest is typically accrued every block. Earning interest per-second is generally expected to perform more predictably in the long-run, even if upgrades to Ethereum lead to changes in the average time between blocks.\n\n#### Feeless Flash Loans \n\nEuler only charges fees according to the time value of money, and from the blockchain's perspective flash loans are held for a duration of 0 seconds. Thus, they are entirely free on Euler (ignoring gas costs).\n",
